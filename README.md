# Student Personal Profile 

We designed a web page using HTML and CSS to represent the Student Personal Profile (SPP) form. The form should capture all key details that a student would normally be required to provide to the school i.e. student_details as per above. 

**Web Page Design**

Firstly, we sketched out what the webpage would look like using Balsamic Wireframes.
Then we used Gitpod IDE to create a basic form for student_details in HTML (index.html).
Added header with school name and logo (also used as the favicon) as well as a footer with the address.
For further functionality, we then created a Javascript file (saveFile.js) to download the form data utilizing BLOBs (Binary Large Objects) to encapsulate the data as a .txt file that can then be saved or used elsewhere.

**Web Page Testing**

Tested form inputs to ensure data validated i.e. integer for age and year, and checked submitted form is downloaded as a .txt file.
The .txt file can then be saved or exported for further use.
We also tested responsiveness of the webpage form for multiple devices on Chrome Dev Tools.
We then tested the HTML, CSS and Javascript code on W3C validator and JSHint.
Once testing had concluded I deployed the webpage by via Github Pages. The steps are as follows:

•	In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.<br>
•	Scroll down to the pages option on the left menu and select.<br>
•	Select the main branch from the build and deployment section.<br>
•	Once the main branch has been saved and the page is refreshed a message is displayed to indicate the successful deployment.<br>
